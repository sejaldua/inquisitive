Text Preprocessing Techniques with Dr. Mahdi Roozbahani & Wafa Louhichi Natural Language Processing Applied Text Analytics & Learning Objectives In this lesson, we will start diving into NLP! •You will be introduced to some NLP terminology •Practice basic preprocessing techniques on text data Some NLP Terminology •Corpus : collection of text •Example: Yelp Reviews, Wikipedia... •Syntax :the grammatical structure of the text •Syntactic parsing: process of analyzing natural language with grammatical rules •Semantics : the meaning of text  Some NLP Terminology •Tokenization : splitting longer pieces of texts into smaller pieces: tokens. Example of splitting a sentence into words: This is a simple sentence -> "This" "is" "a" "simple" "sentence" •Vocabulary : list of unique words Some NLP Terminology •Stop words : commonly used words such as "the", "a","an, "is", "are" … that don't contribute a lot totheoverall meaning •N-Grams: a consecutive sequence of n words (2 -5 is common) in a text. 1 - gram (unigram), 2 -gram(bigram), 3-gram(trigram). Example of bigrams: This is a simple sentence -> "This is", "is a", "a simple", "simple sentence" Preprocessing Text Data •Text data is a form of unstructured data. Text preprocessing is the first step to prepare and clean the text data to perform an NLP task •Useful libraries for text preprocessing: re (Regular expression operations) and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) •Common steps in text preprocessing: •Noise removal •Tokenization •Text normalization Noise removal refers to removing unwanted text formatting information •Punctuation and accent marks •Special characters •Numeric digits or replacing with the word •Leading, ending, and vertical whitespace •HTML formattingNoise Removal  Tokenization •Example of word tokenization using nltk  Text Normalization •Text normalization aims at removing variations in the text and bringing it to a standard form. •Convert all letters to lower or upper case •Removing stop words, sparse terms, and particular words  •Stemming: reducing words to their word stem, base or root form •Lemmatization: similar to stemming, reduces inflectional forms to a common base form : the lemma . Lemmatization does not simply chop off inflections, instead, it uses lexical knowledge bases to get the correct base forms of wordsText Normalization  Summary •Introduction to NLP terminology •Different text preprocessing steps
